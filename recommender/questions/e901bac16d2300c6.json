T testcases follow. <br/>\nEach testcase has 2 lines. The first line is an integer N ( the length of the string). <br/>\nThe second line contains the string S.  </p>\n<p><strong>Output Format</strong> <br/>\nFor each testcase, print the entire list of combinations of string S, with each combination of letters in a newline.</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints</strong> <br/>\n0&lt; T&lt; 50 <br/>\n1&lt; N&lt; 16 <br/>\nstring S contains only small alphabets(a-z) </p>\n<p><strong>Sample Input</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sample Output</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong> <br/>\nIn the first case we have ab, the possibilities are a, ab and b. Similarly, all combination of characters of xyz. </p>\n"
