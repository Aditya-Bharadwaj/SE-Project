Although classes and structures have the same type of functionality, there are some basic differences. The data members of a class are private by default and the members of a structure are public by default. Along with storing multiple data in a common block, it also assigns some functions (known as methods) to manipulate/access them. It serves as the building block of Object Oriented Programming.  </p>\n<p>It also has access specifiers, which restrict the access of member elements. The primarily used ones are the following:</p>\n<p>Class can be represented in the form of</p>\n<p>It's a common practice to make all variables private, and set/get them using public methods. For example:</p>\n<p>We can store details related to a student in a class consisting of his <em>age (int), first_name (string), last_name (string) and standard (int)</em>. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to create a class, named <em>Student</em>, representing the student's details, as mentioned above, and store the data of a student. Create setter and getter functions for each element; that is, the class should at least have following functions:</p>\n<p>Also, you have to create another method <em>to_string()</em> which returns the string consisting of the above elements, separated by a comma(<em>,</em>). You can refer to <em>stringstream</em> for this.</p>\n<p><strong>Input Format</strong></p>\n<p>Input will consist of four lines. <br/>\nThe first line will contain an integer, representing the <em>age</em>.\nThe second line will contain a string, consisting of lower-case Latin characters ('a'-'z'), representing the <em>first_name</em> of a student. <br/>\nThe third line will contain another string, consisting of lower-case Latin characters ('a'-'z'), representing the <em>last_name</em> of a student. <br/>\nThe fourth line will contain an integer, representing the <em>standard</em> of student.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> The number of characters in <em>first_name</em> and <em>last_name</em> will not exceed 50.</p>\n<p><strong>Output Format</strong></p>\n<p>The code provided by HackerRank will use your class members to set and then get the elements of the <em>Student</em> class.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Input</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sample Output</strong></p>\n"
